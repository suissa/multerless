# Collaboration as Code (CaaC) — multerless

This repository is governed by **Collaboration as Code**.

Collaboration is not social.
Collaboration is engineering.

Pull Requests, Issues and Discussions are treated as **signals**, not authority.

All contributions are:

- evaluated automatically
- decided deterministically
- explained explicitly
- never left pending

Human maintainers do not approve changes.
They define **rules, invariants and specifications**.

If a contribution cannot be evaluated by code,
it is rejected by design.
